# Identity and Access Management Devroom @ FOSDEM 2026

[FOSDEM 2026](https://fosdem.org/2026/) will once again have an
[Identity and Access Management devroom](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/iam/),
following its successful runs in 2018, 2024, and 2025.

The IAM devroom is scheduled to be held on **Sunday, February 1st, 2026**
in Brussels, Belgium at [ULB](https://www.ulb.be/).
Exact room allocation will be known in December 2025.

## Our topics this year

This is the Identity and Access Management Devroom.
We invite you to submit a talk that is relevant to operating systems’ identity and access management
in the free software and open source world.

We don’t exclude any relevant submission; for ideas and suggestions,
please check the previous editions of the IAM devroom
([2018](https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/track/identity_and_access_management/),
[2024](https://archive.fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/identity-and-access-management/),
[2025](https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/iam/)).

Suggested topics, based on our 2026 proposal, include:

**The future of authentication:**
* The path to ubiquitous Passwordless: Passkeys, FIDO2, OAuth2, and PIV in practice
for operating system access.
* Beyond Centralization: Decentralized Identity (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in FOSS.
* Integrating federated and social identities at the operating system level.

**Core infrastructure & security:**
* Preparing for Y2Q: Implementing quantum-resistant cryptography (QRC) in authentication protocols.
* DNS and Identity: Securing enterprise and personal domains for identity services.
* Identity in the Software Supply Chain (e.g., how identity concepts apply to services like Sigstore).

**User experience & integration:**
* Integrating modern authentication across desktop environments (GNOME, KDE)
and system administration toolchains.
* Improving the user experience for multi-factor authentication.

**Project showcases & case studies:**
* Free software IAM offerings; migrating from or integrating with proprietary solutions.
* IAM/IdM deployment reports and real-world case studies.

...and more. Don’t be shy and show how your project helps to improve our lives.
